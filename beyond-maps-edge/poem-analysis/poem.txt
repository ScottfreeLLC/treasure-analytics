Can you find what lives in time,
Flowing through each measured rhyme?
Wisdom waits in shadowed sight—
For those who read these words just right.

As hope surges, clear and bright,
Walk near waters’ silent flight.
Round the bend, past the Hole,
I wait for you to cast your pole.

In ursa east his realm awaits;
His bride stands guard at ancient gates.
Her foot of three at twenty degree,
Return her face to find the place.

Double arcs on granite bold,
Where secrets of the past still hold.
Beyond the reach of time’s swift race,
Wonder guards this sacred space.

Truth rests not in clever minds,
Not in tangled, twisted finds.
Like a river’s steady flow—
What you seek, you already know.
