1,"00:00:06,631","00:00:10,343","I wanted to let you know, I've hidden some clues in that interview setup."
2,"00:00:11,219","00:00:12,011","Oh"
3,"00:00:12,011","00:00:15,181","Within all the spaces you guys have filmed in my house."
4,"00:00:16,224","00:00:16,850","Clues to what?"
5,"00:00:18,268","00:00:20,061","Well, I'm planning on hiding a treasure."
6,"00:00:21,312","00:00:21,813","What treasure?"
7,"00:00:22,897","00:00:23,773","Well, hopefully, Forrest's."
8,"00:00:24,524","00:00:24,983","[Dog barking]"
9,"00:00:25,191","00:00:26,860","In the early days of the treasure hunt,"
10,"00:00:27,652","00:00:30,238","it was that true American adventure."
11,"00:00:32,991","00:00:36,828","And it was a beacon of hope for so many people."
12,"00:00:37,412","00:00:41,541","And that's something that is exceedingly hard to come by in the modern era."
13,"00:00:42,250","00:00:45,295","is an adventure with hopes and dreams."
14,"00:00:56,347","00:00:58,850","I think, especially to those that knew me pretty well,"
15,"00:00:59,184","00:01:01,978","it was not a surprise that I got wrapped up in the treasure hunt."
16,"00:01:02,979","00:01:05,690","Most of my family and friends would categorize me as eccentric."
17,"00:01:06,065","00:01:06,399","You ready?"
18,"00:01:08,067","00:01:09,194","Ready as I'll ever be."
19,"00:01:11,321","00:01:13,656","I have a huge variety of hobbies."
20,"00:01:14,282","00:01:16,826","And I have a lot of different things that interest me."
21,"00:01:22,665","00:01:26,961","From woodworking to titanium anodizing in the garage,"
22,"00:01:27,629","00:01:32,926","to just a little experiment around near-infrared wavelengths as a way to create,"
23,"00:01:33,134","00:01:35,386","well, x-ray vision effectively,"
24,"00:01:36,679","00:01:39,140","to software engineering, which is my main gig,"
25,"00:01:41,476","00:01:43,436","and a bit of rare artifact collecting."
26,"00:01:44,229","00:01:45,730","This is a project I'm working on."
27,"00:01:45,730","00:01:47,440","These are actually coins that I've gathered"
28,"00:01:47,440","00:01:50,193","from all around the world and from different eras."
29,"00:01:50,944","00:01:52,487","This one, I think, is pretty special."
30,"00:01:53,112","00:01:55,365","A 1652 oak-tree shilling."
31,"00:01:56,241","00:02:00,286","The currency that helped form us, America."
32,"00:02:03,039","00:02:04,457","I was always really into history."
33,"00:02:05,667","00:02:07,585","I think that's something I got from my family."
34,"00:02:11,047","00:02:12,340","So I grew up in Tucson, Arizona."
35,"00:02:13,508","00:02:17,595","My grandfather was the fishing game warden up in Montana, Wyoming, that whole area."
36,"00:02:18,638","00:02:20,348","I spent a lot of summers up there myself."
37,"00:02:21,975","00:02:24,561","And my grandfather taught me to get out and"
38,"00:02:24,561","00:02:27,105","explore and camp hike all of those things."
39,"00:02:28,106","00:02:32,235","I got a metal detector, and I must have put thousands of hours on that thing."
40,"00:02:34,320","00:02:37,115","I strongly believe that treasures can and do exist."
41,"00:02:39,576","00:02:41,035","That's been true since I was a kid."
42,"00:02:42,161","00:02:43,997","Happy birthday to Grandma and Grandpa."
43,"00:02:44,789","00:02:45,832","Oh, that's nice."
44,"00:02:47,625","00:02:49,544","Guess what it is?"
45,"00:02:50,044","00:02:50,753","I don't have a clue."
46,"00:02:51,462","00:02:52,881","It's like a wild fisherman."
47,"00:02:54,090","00:02:55,967","Gold! I told you. Gold books!"
48,"00:02:56,843","00:02:59,012","I became the family's resident treasure hunter."
49,"00:03:00,430","00:03:03,766","I think the Victoria Peak treasure was the catalyst at its core."
50,"00:03:03,766","00:03:05,476","It was just such a cool story."
51,"00:03:06,102","00:03:08,646","In the 90s, that treasure hunt was a pretty big deal."
52,"00:03:09,272","00:03:12,275","A search started this week for a legendary treasure in New Mexico."
53,"00:03:12,650","00:03:14,944","It is supposed to be down a hole, this hole,"
54,"00:03:14,944","00:03:16,821","on the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico."
55,"00:03:17,655","00:03:20,825","It's like every kid's most amazing dream ever."
56,"00:03:21,409","00:03:24,162","Stumbling upon a cavern with that sort of fortune."
57,"00:03:25,788","00:03:26,748","Who wouldn't want that?"
58,"00:03:27,081","00:03:29,042","Like, who wouldn't want to be Indiana Jones?"
59,"00:03:30,668","00:03:32,962","He enters this cave, and he's going into this"
60,"00:03:32,962","00:03:35,423","room with this idol in the center and swiping it."
61,"00:03:36,883","00:03:39,302","I mean, fortune and glory."
62,"00:03:44,474","00:03:46,559","And so then, jumped two years later, when I"
63,"00:03:46,559","00:03:48,227","first heard about the Forrest Fenn treasure,"
64,"00:03:48,895","00:03:51,773","it really reignited that spark from my childhood."
65,"00:03:52,732","00:03:54,734","This was like a needle in a football field."
66,"00:03:55,693","00:03:58,196","It was 10 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches."
67,"00:03:59,155","00:04:00,865","In the vast Rocky Mountain wilderness."
68,"00:04:03,034","00:04:04,619","I felt myself getting more interested."
69,"00:04:06,621","00:04:10,291","I think it's fair to say that at some point, the"
70,"00:04:10,291","00:04:14,087","treasure hunt culminated into something more than a hobby."
71,"00:04:14,754","00:04:17,048","I'm still doing my work professionally and everything."
72,"00:04:18,716","00:04:20,301","Mornings, evenings, weekends."
73,"00:04:21,970","00:04:23,137","I'm doing treasure hunting."
74,"00:04:25,807","00:04:28,685","When the hunt started, we had very little to go off of."
75,"00:04:29,269","00:04:33,606","There was always that thought in the back of my mind that it was buried."
76,"00:04:33,648","00:04:36,150","If something's buried, the odds are"
77,"00:04:36,150","00:04:38,695","astronomically low that you'd ever succeed at finding it."
78,"00:04:39,946","00:04:42,991","I realized that a bit of scientific process was"
79,"00:04:42,991","00:04:46,160","needed in order to have any sort of chance at finding this."
80,"00:04:47,161","00:04:49,580","I had read this article that most dogs can"
81,"00:04:49,580","00:04:52,792","detect different precious metals 6 plus feet down."
82,"00:04:53,918","00:04:57,964","My thought was I could train Tucker to specifically"
83,"00:04:57,964","00:05:02,635","sniff out bronze, because the treasure chest is bronze."
84,"00:05:04,095","00:05:04,887","So we gave it a shot."
85,"00:05:05,430","00:05:06,514","At first, it was just treats."
86,"00:05:07,515","00:05:09,892","And then it was treats plus pieces of bronze."
87,"00:05:11,102","00:05:13,521","And the big switch happened where I removed"
88,"00:05:13,521","00:05:15,815","the treats entirely and it was just bronze."
89,"00:05:18,151","00:05:20,570","And I think what we discovered pretty quickly is"
90,"00:05:20,570","00:05:23,114","that you could smell bronze at least 4 feet down."
91,"00:05:23,364","00:05:24,866","And that was more than enough."
92,"00:05:26,534","00:05:29,245","I had an unparalleled level of confidence."
93,"00:05:30,621","00:05:33,166","We're going to find it. Yeah, we're going to find it."
94,"00:05:33,166","00:05:34,208","We're just going to take some time."
95,"00:05:35,460","00:05:38,838","After Tucker did a pass, I never had to go back."
96,"00:05:40,256","00:05:44,552","So now that we had the secret weapon, the next question was, where do we start?"
97,"00:05:45,845","00:05:48,222","You know, you've got to start at the beginning."
98,"00:05:48,765","00:05:51,434","You start where warm waters halt and that kicks off the adventure."
99,"00:05:52,727","00:05:55,605","There were so many different interpretations of where warm waters halt."
100,"00:05:56,647","00:05:59,776","The first time that I went out searching for the"
101,"00:05:59,776","00:06:02,070","treasure, I had done a lot of research ahead of time."
102,"00:06:02,653","00:06:05,323","I would scour all the Rocky Mountains for place"
103,"00:06:05,323","00:06:07,450","names that would resemble anything kind of warm."
104,"00:06:08,409","00:06:11,954","Well, what warms the water? Well, the sun. Or more specifically, the sunlight."
105,"00:06:13,164","00:06:15,625","So I found a sunlight basin in Wyoming."
106,"00:06:16,334","00:06:21,339","We had sunlight creek that comes off the mountain and it ends a dead Indian pass."
107,"00:06:21,672","00:06:24,634","And so the warm water halts as those two come together."
108,"00:06:24,675","00:06:31,390","The cherry on top. In the summertime, the snow melts and an X appears on the side"
109,"00:06:31,390","00:06:34,268","of the mountain, like at least 100 by 100 feet."
110,"00:06:39,190","00:06:43,778","If we take it in the canyon down, well, in sunlight basin, there's sunlight gorge."
111,"00:06:44,529","00:06:47,657","A gorge is a canyon. That's the solution to the second clue."
112,"00:06:49,117","00:06:50,618","So that was going to be our starting point."
113,"00:06:51,661","00:06:55,414","What's the third clue? Not far, but too far to walk."
114,"00:06:56,082","00:06:59,669","There's some place you need to go that isn't far, but you can't walk it."
115,"00:07:01,087","00:07:06,050","And so I found the only place in Cody that would rent ATVs."
116,"00:07:10,638","00:07:13,641","Home of Brown was hard. I couldn't figure it out."
117,"00:07:14,642","00:07:16,811","And it just so happened as you traverse sunlight"
118,"00:07:16,811","00:07:21,107","basin, you can't help but pass by the JD Salinger Ranch."
119,"00:07:21,941","00:07:24,402","Forrest talked about Catcher in the Rye in his book"
120,"00:07:24,402","00:07:26,946","several times. He talked about Catcher in the Rye."
121,"00:07:27,613","00:07:30,616","The publisher for Salinger was little Brown and company."
122,"00:07:31,701","00:07:33,870","So as far as I was concerned, Salinger Ranch is"
123,"00:07:33,870","00:07:36,164","the home of Brown, right? I mean, how fitting."
124,"00:07:37,248","00:07:40,001","It's like, okay, from here, it's no place for the meek."
125,"00:07:41,335","00:07:42,336","I guess I'll turn it off."
126,"00:07:42,628","00:07:45,256","And so you go off into the woods, like you got to be brave."
127,"00:07:46,674","00:07:50,428","Oh, shit. We got to go."
128,"00:07:50,636","00:07:53,723","Just keep talking in low voice, get your fair sprays at the ready."
129,"00:07:54,307","00:07:56,517","Everything started lining up even stronger and"
130,"00:07:56,517","00:07:59,312","stronger, and then you get the end as ever drawing nigh."
131,"00:07:59,854","00:08:02,815","Make sure you keep your eyes open. Anywhere through here is fair game."
132,"00:08:03,107","00:08:05,109","It's somewhere in this immediate vicinity."
133,"00:08:08,029","00:08:10,615","Trying to figure out what this heavy loads was and this water high,"
134,"00:08:10,656","00:08:12,783","and we really just couldn't quite piece it together."
135,"00:08:13,242","00:08:14,702","And sometimes you just need to take a step"
136,"00:08:14,702","00:08:17,121","back and reanalyze and get a new footing."
137,"00:08:18,456","00:08:20,249","It helps kind of hit that reset."
138,"00:08:22,168","00:08:24,712","I think he just reveled in saying things"
139,"00:08:24,712","00:08:26,714","that could be interpreted in any number of ways."
140,"00:08:29,258","00:08:33,054","It was fun for him. It was a game, but it's also like really serious."
141,"00:08:33,763","00:08:36,057","The stakes were extremely high and searchers were"
142,"00:08:36,057","00:08:37,642","doing anything they could to give themselves an edge."
143,"00:08:41,020","00:08:43,940","I was still looking for a new way through the poem, so I"
144,"00:08:43,940","00:08:47,193","was paying close attention to everything Forrest was saying."
145,"00:08:51,280","00:08:53,783","There were thousands of solutions that I considered."
146,"00:08:56,202","00:09:04,543","Over the years, I searched Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and I realized over time,"
147,"00:09:05,044","00:09:07,630","the poem could be made to fit a plethora of locations."
148,"00:09:08,631","00:09:14,011","Hundreds and hundreds of days of searching, and it just wasn't working."
149,"00:09:15,471","00:09:16,681","Didn't sleep well last night."
150,"00:09:18,099","00:09:19,934","I was very sleep deprived."
151,"00:09:20,893","00:09:24,313","There has to be a different way of approaching this."
152,"00:09:24,730","00:09:27,692","This trial and error just doesn't work."
153,"00:09:30,319","00:09:34,991","And thus, the idea was born of using facial recognition, where you could actually"
154,"00:09:34,991","00:09:36,617","look at all the interviews that Forrest did,"
155,"00:09:36,659","00:09:38,744","and analyze those."
156,"00:09:40,162","00:09:43,916","There's a series of what's called micro-expressions or action units that form."
157,"00:09:44,959","00:09:48,587","There's relative eyebrow movement, pursed lips,"
158,"00:09:49,380","00:09:52,633","parted lips, that I'm just scratching the surface of."
159,"00:09:53,634","00:09:56,846","If you can unlock for a person a set of"
160,"00:09:56,846","00:10:00,850","micro-expressions that indicate something suspicious, that's gold."
161,"00:10:02,143","00:10:05,646","There was a Lorene Mills interview that happened early in the chase."
162,"00:10:06,647","00:10:09,608","Lorene Mills and welcome to report from Santa Fe."
163,"00:10:10,192","00:10:13,321","There were a few times during that interview where the"
164,"00:10:13,321","00:10:17,325","micro-expressions strongly suggested a fear response."
165,"00:10:18,326","00:10:23,164","That happened when Forrest was asked something about Yellowstone."
166,"00:10:23,581","00:10:28,711","I can't remember how many times that I could hardly wait in Yellowstone to go trout"
167,"00:10:28,711","00:10:31,630","fishing on the Madison River, the Gallatin, the Farhol, the Gibbon."
168,"00:10:31,630","00:10:36,052","After I created that software, I had a strong belief that"
169,"00:10:36,052","00:10:38,888","the treasure was located in this Yellowstone National Park."
170,"00:10:44,477","00:10:48,522","His plan was to float the Rio Grande in January or February."
171,"00:10:52,651","00:10:54,362","I think he got a raft from Walmart."
172,"00:10:54,653","00:10:57,782","The raft was found nine miles further"
173,"00:10:57,782","00:11:01,952","downstream. Miraculously, little Leo was still alive."
174,"00:11:01,952","00:11:05,164","How do you get to come back from losing a life? And"
175,"00:11:05,164","00:11:08,876","that's the crux of this. It's a double-edged sword."
176,"00:11:09,251","00:11:14,006","I certainly couldn't fault him for any reason based on how things had transpired."
177,"00:11:15,174","00:11:21,347","He was really stuck between a rock and a hard place. Really was."
178,"00:11:23,974","00:11:26,644","I had this driving obsession to find this before anyone else."
179,"00:11:28,729","00:11:31,190","Treasure Hunt was like someone offering you a"
180,"00:11:31,190","00:11:33,067","ticket and saying you want to take the ride."
181,"00:11:34,902","00:11:37,405","I took the ticket. My advice is if someone"
182,"00:11:37,405","00:11:39,573","gives you a ticket to ride, you take the ride."
183,"00:11:43,619","00:11:47,373","I have to wonder if Forrest knew everything that would come to pass,"
184,"00:11:47,373","00:11:51,293","would he have hidden the treasure again and would he have done things differently?"
185,"00:11:51,293","00:11:57,633","It's amazing how quickly the narrative for"
186,"00:11:57,633","00:12:02,054","something truly amazing can shift so dramatically."
187,"00:12:03,639","00:12:07,017","Forrest was getting pressure at that time to just call this off."
188,"00:12:08,727","00:12:11,313","I wrote a letter to Forrest and I told him"
189,"00:12:11,313","00:12:15,443","that while we are in the wake of a true tragedy,"
190,"00:12:15,943","00:12:20,489","don't forget the vision that you had. I know"
191,"00:12:20,489","00:12:23,409","that you didn't want to imperil anyone's life,"
192,"00:12:24,618","00:12:26,871","but it felt like we had a very fleeting"
193,"00:12:26,871","00:12:29,623","window of time in order to find the treasure."
194,"00:12:32,668","00:12:35,087","After I created that facial recognition software,"
195,"00:12:36,046","00:12:38,340","I had a strong belief that the treasure"
196,"00:12:38,340","00:12:40,718","was located in the Yellowstone National Park."
197,"00:12:43,179","00:12:47,183","I knew it was there somewhere. All the data had lined up."
198,"00:12:48,142","00:12:52,563","Now there's a story in the book where he talks about going to fish with his father"
199,"00:12:52,897","00:12:55,774","on the Fire Hole, the Madison and the Gibbon"
200,"00:12:55,774","00:12:58,194","River. I can't remember how many times that I"
201,"00:12:58,277","00:13:00,988","could hardly wait in Yellowstone to go trout"
202,"00:13:00,988","00:13:03,073","fishing on the Madison River, the Gallatin,"
203,"00:13:03,073","00:13:05,367","the Fire Hole, the Gibbon. All of which are"
204,"00:13:05,367","00:13:08,037","relatively warm bodies of water. Fire Hole"
205,"00:13:08,204","00:13:10,873","and the Gibbon end abruptly and the"
206,"00:13:10,873","00:13:14,001","Madison begins. So when you talk about where warm"
207,"00:13:14,001","00:13:19,715","waters halt, waters is plural. You've got three major bodies of water on the map."
208,"00:13:20,633","00:13:24,386","That's a very compelling starting location. The"
209,"00:13:24,386","00:13:26,805","second clue is, "And take it in the canyon down.""
210,"00:13:27,389","00:13:29,517","Well, he's a fisherman. What does down mean?"
211,"00:13:29,975","00:13:32,603","Down means downstream. That's Madison Canyon."
212,"00:13:33,479","00:13:35,064","From there it's put in below the home of"
213,"00:13:35,064","00:13:37,441","Brown. I think immediately about fishing holes."
214,"00:13:37,983","00:13:39,777","Great places to fish for brown trout."
215,"00:13:40,736","00:13:43,531","Furthermore, he's got his father standing in front of this"
216,"00:13:43,697","00:13:49,370","large rock that nine mile home. I was so"
217,"00:13:49,370","00:13:51,789","excited. I immediately called my brother Brandon."
218,"00:13:52,748","00:13:54,583","Okay, let's go over here."
219,"00:13:55,960","00:14:08,847","Brandon was three years younger than I was. He"
220,"00:14:08,847","00:14:12,351","followed me everywhere and we were always on the"
221,"00:14:12,351","00:14:17,356","verge of the next great discovery. When I started"
222,"00:14:17,356","00:14:19,900","as treasure hunt, I had probably shared hundreds"
223,"00:14:20,025","00:14:23,487","of solves, Brandon, and up until that time he"
224,"00:14:23,487","00:14:27,992","hadn't really been all that invested. But that time,"
225,"00:14:28,617","00:14:32,121","his response was, ""Huh, that actually might make some sense."""
226,"00:14:34,498","00:14:38,127","After I told him about the solution, he wanted to come out and search together."
227,"00:14:40,045","00:14:44,425","It was more than just a treasure hunt. It was a way for us to spend time together."
228,"00:14:45,217","00:14:50,139","We slowly worked our way down the canyon and I could see as I walked through it,"
229,"00:14:50,139","00:14:53,642","his excitement continued to grow to the point where he was invested."
230,"00:14:54,768","00:14:57,062","We walked right up to that rock and it was an"
231,"00:14:57,062","00:15:00,441","aha moment because it was directly out of the book."
232,"00:15:03,652","00:15:05,362","When we made it to the other side of the river,"
233,"00:15:05,487","00:15:11,452","it was all new growth. A lot of them are"
234,"00:15:11,452","00:15:15,080","chest height to head height on me, and you're just"
235,"00:15:15,080","00:15:19,918","wading through them. You're covered in sap, torn"
236,"00:15:19,918","00:15:23,380","up from head to toe. That was probably weeks of"
237,"00:15:23,380","00:15:28,135","work. Anything? The hunt continues. It's still"
238,"00:15:28,135","00:15:30,721","no luck. However, I didn't have the confidence"
239,"00:15:30,763","00:15:35,142","that I can safely eliminate this. Tucker would"
240,"00:15:35,142","00:15:38,103","sniff out bronze anywhere. The problem was the"
241,"00:15:38,103","00:15:49,281","law. Yellowstone does not allow dogs on trails. And without Tucker there, it was,"
242,"00:15:52,117","00:15:53,786","I felt like you were searching blind."
243,"00:15:56,705","00:15:57,456","Speak of the devil."
244,"00:16:03,253","00:16:08,550","So many people believed it was them. I must be this close. What if this is me?"
245,"00:16:09,760","00:16:13,347","And you know, I thought about that too, because I would send forest emails."
246,"00:16:14,515","00:16:17,434","So he knew areas that I was searching in."
247,"00:16:18,102","00:16:19,895","And so when he would come out and say, oh,"
248,"00:16:19,895","00:16:22,022","you know, there's somebody who's within 200 feet"
249,"00:16:22,022","00:16:24,400","or something, you know, everybody wonders, is that"
250,"00:16:24,441","00:16:32,157","that me? The search season for me would depend on snow melt. So February, March,"
251,"00:16:32,157","00:16:34,827","start getting itchy. So you'd be on the computer"
252,"00:16:34,827","00:16:37,663","checking this no depth reports of different areas,"
253,"00:16:37,663","00:16:39,164","trying to figure out when it's going to"
254,"00:16:39,164","00:16:41,709","clear. That's when the search season would begin."
255,"00:16:47,047","00:16:49,717","In early January, I was prepping for the next"
256,"00:16:49,717","00:16:54,263","season. I was headed toward Yellowstone to search"
257,"00:16:54,263","00:16:58,517","the nine mile whole area again. When I got"
258,"00:16:58,517","00:17:02,896","a call from my mother, she was very upset."
259,"00:17:05,733","00:17:10,362","My brother Brandon was missing. So I hopped"
260,"00:17:10,362","00:17:12,865","on the first plane out and went to Tucson."
261,"00:17:13,532","00:17:17,786","It was just kind of frantic to find him. He had"
262,"00:17:17,786","00:17:21,081","left a note, had a symbol on it. And I figured"
263,"00:17:21,165","00:17:24,084","out it was basically a mile marker post"
264,"00:17:24,084","00:17:28,297","just east of Tucson. So that's where I went."
265,"00:17:30,090","00:17:34,303","I pretty quickly found his pack and a towel up on"
266,"00:17:34,303","00:17:37,556","the mountainside. I was pretty concerned at that"
267,"00:17:37,556","00:17:42,561","point. And so I called search and rescue. He had"
268,"00:17:42,561","00:17:45,647","left some messages in the area that I knew came"
269,"00:17:45,731","00:17:49,818","from him. And the last one that I found was the"
270,"00:17:49,818","00:17:52,696","name Forrest Fenn with the ex marks, the spot."
271,"00:17:56,116","00:18:04,124","But I couldn't find him. I just couldn't find him."
272,"00:18:07,127","00:18:10,255","Eventually, he was found up on the mountainside."
273,"00:18:10,422","00:18:20,349","He shot himself."
274,"00:18:24,269","00:18:28,565","The autopsy report showed that if I had figured out that message sooner,"
275,"00:18:29,858","00:18:31,860","it would have probably been a different ending."
276,"00:18:31,860","00:18:41,370","Damn. He was my responsibility."
277,"00:18:43,997","00:18:51,088","I was disappointed in myself, but I made a"
278,"00:18:51,088","00:18:53,632","pact with myself at that time that I would keep"
279,"00:18:53,674","00:19:02,391","searching. I felt that I owed it to him to find what we had started to hunt for."
280,"00:19:07,396","00:19:13,318","I went back to Wyoming and I tore that place up."
281,"00:19:14,403","00:19:16,321","I searched an area that probably shouldn't have"
282,"00:19:16,446","00:19:19,157","been where I know I shouldn't have. I really did"
283,"00:19:19,157","00:19:23,078","throw personal safety to the wind. I didn't have"
284,"00:19:24,037","00:19:29,042","any other thought than finding that. There was a belief that Forrest's family held,"
285,"00:19:29,042","00:19:32,129","they called it an intervention, and had asked"
286,"00:19:32,129","00:19:35,007","him to stop the treasure hunt for their own safety."
287,"00:19:35,632","00:19:37,885","I certainly would not have faulted them if they"
288,"00:19:37,885","00:19:40,637","had done that. And he probably thought that by"
289,"00:19:40,637","00:19:44,141","continuing with this treasure hunt, I risked my"
290,"00:19:44,141","00:19:46,351","own personal safety and probably more importantly"
291,"00:19:46,435","00:19:52,065","to him is his family. All of a sudden it was"
292,"00:19:52,065","00:19:54,526","clear I was running out of time to find the treasure."
293,"00:19:55,569","00:19:58,614","It's really rare for me to find a situation"
294,"00:19:58,614","00:20:02,659","where data drove me to a location that also"
295,"00:20:02,659","00:20:08,248","coincided with, dare I say, a feeling. Yellowstone feels like Forrest."
296,"00:20:08,290","00:20:16,965","I felt very confident that there was a short list of places where this could be."
297,"00:20:17,841","00:20:19,635","And as I walked around Yellowstone, I just"
298,"00:20:19,635","00:20:23,096","felt myself getting closer and closer and closer."
299,"00:20:23,889","00:20:28,852","No way. There's no way. My phone started dinging and blowing up, getting messages"
300,"00:20:28,894","00:20:33,273","from all sorts of people. And I thought, oh boy, somebody's making something up."
301,"00:20:34,024","00:20:41,365","But then, or as a message on his webpage, to say that the treasure had been found"
302,"00:20:42,115","00:20:48,246","under a canopy of stars in the lush forest of the Rocky Mountains."
303,"00:20:51,291","00:20:56,505","The growing angst in the community was reaching a tipping point where information"
304,"00:20:56,713","00:21:01,760","when forest was becoming almost a necessity despite the frustration."
305,"00:21:02,427","00:21:06,974","I have to admit I felt a twinge of envy when I saw what was in the chest."
306,"00:21:08,016","00:21:13,563","Gold nuggets and coins and all sorts of things that were just dazzling to the eye."
307,"00:21:13,563","00:21:14,564","It was a big eye catcher."
308,"00:21:15,357","00:21:21,279","I remember feeling sadness and some level of disappointment."
309,"00:21:21,613","00:21:27,953","Not in him, but just in the situation and the"
310,"00:21:27,953","00:21:32,207","real potential that the truth may never be known."
311,"00:21:33,125","00:21:36,044","The video of Jack really did move the needle for me."
312,"00:21:36,294","00:21:39,172","It was clear that Jack was maybe the only"
313,"00:21:39,172","00:21:42,509","person on the planet who knew the solution."
314,"00:21:45,137","00:21:46,471","Thanks for watching."
315,"00:21:46,972","00:21:50,183","He also made it pretty clear he didn't want to give any further information."
316,"00:21:51,768","00:21:54,229","And so the community did what the community does."
317,"00:21:54,229","00:21:57,065","They started digging in deep and they found"
318,"00:21:57,065","00:21:59,526","the Reddit handle that he used from years prior,"
319,"00:21:59,735","00:22:01,403","allegedly the Condor 2."
320,"00:22:01,403","00:22:04,406","And that meant I could go back and garner a lot of additional information."
321,"00:22:04,865","00:22:07,117","There were some really interesting tidbits there."
322,"00:22:07,576","00:22:10,996","Specifically, he calls out Madison Canyon where I had searched."
323,"00:22:11,204","00:22:14,791","He calls out Nine Mile Hole where I spent lots of time with my brother."
324,"00:22:15,250","00:22:17,377","And he does so very specifically."
325,"00:22:21,089","00:22:23,425","And so, thanks to the community and the"
326,"00:22:23,425","00:22:26,887","evidence gathered from other searchers, I went back."
327,"00:22:28,096","00:22:30,807","I was determined to know where Forrest had hid that treasure."
328,"00:22:32,601","00:22:33,185","This is amazing."
329,"00:22:33,435","00:22:33,852","Look at this."
330,"00:22:33,852","00:22:39,483","I felt that by finding the location, would actually have"
331,"00:22:41,151","00:22:43,612","the closure that I would need to move on."
332,"00:22:44,237","00:22:48,825","And the completion of that pact that I had made to find this."
333,"00:22:49,326","00:22:51,036","My brother always told me, he says, "If"
334,"00:22:51,036","00:22:52,746","anybody's going to find that thing, it's you."
335,"00:22:54,289","00:22:57,417","And I wanted to make that happen for him."
336,"00:22:59,878","00:23:01,588","So I returned to Nine Mile Hole,"
337,"00:23:02,255","00:23:06,301","the place where we had searched together to finish what we had started."
338,"00:23:07,719","00:23:13,183","But without that 10 inch by 10 inch by five inch chest out there, what is there?"
339,"00:23:13,183","00:23:13,934","What do you have?"
340,"00:23:15,352","00:23:21,066","Well, I had a heavily cropped photo that showed some detritus pine cones."
341,"00:23:23,902","00:23:26,071","And that was about it."
342,"00:23:27,614","00:23:27,948","Okay."
343,"00:23:28,949","00:23:29,282","Into the creek."
344,"00:23:31,618","00:23:33,954","[dog barking]"
345,"00:23:34,371","00:23:35,205","Let's see."
346,"00:23:39,042","00:23:40,293","Anything jumps out."
347,"00:23:45,882","00:23:53,807","I had pretty high confidence that I was in the right general area."
348,"00:23:56,309","00:23:58,854","But knowing the general area wasn't enough for me,"
349,"00:23:58,895","00:24:01,648","I wanted to point to a spot on the ground and say,"
350,"00:24:02,190","00:24:03,900",""It was sitting right here and here's why.""
351,"00:24:06,987","00:24:08,613","So I kept searching."
352,"00:24:11,533","00:24:12,075","Let's go."
353,"00:24:13,368","00:24:15,871","Day after day after day after day."
354,"00:24:17,455","00:24:20,333","Twig after twig after twig after twig."
355,"00:24:21,209","00:24:22,878","Just a crazy man looking for a stick."
356,"00:24:29,301","00:24:40,145","But I just couldn't find it."
357,"00:24:40,478","00:24:42,022","And did you ever consider quitting?"
358,"00:24:43,148","00:24:43,732","You must have."
359,"00:24:45,192","00:24:45,400","Yes."
360,"00:24:53,283","00:24:54,075","But did you?"
361,"00:25:02,042","00:25:04,753","Slowly but surely wins the race."
362,"00:25:07,380","00:25:08,632","We made it to the bank."
363,"00:25:11,509","00:25:11,718","Okay."
364,"00:25:13,720","00:25:14,095","All right."
365,"00:25:15,805","00:25:17,140","Let's start down here."
366,"00:25:20,477","00:25:20,852","Okay."
367,"00:25:21,895","00:25:23,188","Josh, stick through here."
368,"00:25:24,231","00:25:25,065","Check the other side."

375,"00:26:00,183","00:26:03,395","I mean, it must be just right in front of my nose."
376,"00:26:14,155","00:26:14,906","Wait a minute."
377,"00:26:14,906","00:26:15,282","What are you doing?"
378,"00:26:18,034","00:26:19,119","I got to compare photos."

380,"00:26:30,922","00:26:31,131","Okay."
381,"00:26:44,185","00:26:45,228","I think this is it."
382,"00:26:50,483","00:26:52,986","In fact, it just damn well lines up perfectly."
383,"00:26:54,362","00:26:58,241","I think this is it."
384,"00:26:58,700","00:26:59,534","I really do."
385,"00:27:02,912","00:27:05,165","If you were going to put me in the spot and say,"

394,"00:27:25,727","00:27:27,270","Not far, but too far to walk."
395,"00:27:28,063","00:27:29,564","But in below the home of Brown."
396,"00:27:30,982","00:27:32,025","What is home of Brown?"
397,"00:27:32,400","00:27:33,818","That is my mile hole."
398,"00:27:34,486","00:27:37,614","That is the home of the Brown trout where forest used to fish."

404,"00:27:50,460","00:27:53,797","That is going into the woods or off the beaten path."

406,"00:27:57,717","00:27:59,636","look quickly down your quest to cease."
407,"00:28:00,720","00:28:05,809","I believe the blaze was a tree that has since fallen over"
408,"00:28:06,476","00:28:09,145","and that the treasure was very at the base of the tree."
409,"00:28:10,563","00:28:14,984","Just sitting there for 10 years, only 500 feet from the road."
410,"00:28:18,738","00:28:19,239","That's crazy."
411,"00:28:20,365","00:28:23,368","It is."
412,"00:28:38,341","00:28:40,552","2016, my brother came to Yellowstone with me."
413,"00:28:44,472","00:28:45,598","He searched this canyon."
414,"00:28:46,599","00:28:46,975","We searched."
415,"00:28:51,020","00:28:52,272","We searched right through here."
416,"00:28:52,272","00:28:53,231","We walked through here."

420,"00:29:05,410","00:29:16,254","I just wish my brother wasn't around to see it."
421,"00:29:18,798","00:29:24,929","But I'm thankful for the time that we had to search together."
422,"00:29:27,348","00:29:28,725","Because that's what this is all about."

427,"00:29:50,914","00:29:54,209","At that point, I felt that I might be in a position where"
428,"00:29:55,627","00:29:58,004","I could buy the chest, I could buy the treasure,"
429,"00:29:58,505","00:30:02,800","and then re-hide it."
430,"00:30:05,261","00:30:07,222","That's basically it."
431,"00:30:09,849","00:30:10,058","Yeah."
432,"00:30:13,728","00:30:16,689","Kind of makes you wonder how I never find a"

443,"00:30:36,376","00:30:36,751","Thank you."
444,"00:30:41,714","00:30:44,050","If you'd like to have a seat right here,"

449,"00:30:49,597","00:30:51,432","you can see the items a little bit more clearly"
450,"00:30:51,516","00:30:52,642","under these lights."
451,"00:30:54,978","00:30:55,103","Yeah."

453,"00:31:20,169","00:31:22,171","So you can feel the weight of it."
454,"00:31:26,009","00:31:26,718","It's heavy."
455,"00:31:27,260","00:31:27,677","Imagine that."
456,"00:31:28,511","00:31:29,512","I mean, it's so dense."
457,"00:31:30,597","00:31:31,055","Wow."
458,"00:31:31,431","00:31:33,558","I mean, I still see the original dirt on it."
459,"00:31:33,558","00:31:34,350","That is amazing."
460,"00:31:36,227","00:31:38,605","Did you guys do any sort of restoration on it at all?"
461,"00:31:38,813","00:31:39,564","Nothing's been done to anything."
462,"00:31:39,564","00:31:40,273","That's fantastic."
463,"00:31:40,940","00:31:41,149","Oh."
464,"00:31:44,193","00:31:48,156","That is so cool."

466,"00:31:55,413","00:31:56,331","And the rusty key."
467,"00:31:56,414","00:31:58,541","Right inside."
468,"00:31:59,834","00:32:01,419","Probably doesn't work in here any longer."
469,"00:32:01,753","00:32:02,837","I'd be afraid to try."
470,"00:32:02,837","00:32:03,504","It's a good try."

477,"00:32:35,536","00:32:37,080","It's just kind of overwhelming."
478,"00:32:40,500","00:32:43,294","For the heft, the two biggest nuggets."
479,"00:32:44,545","00:32:46,756","The guys, the way you just pull."
480,"00:32:47,924","00:32:48,591","It's amazing."
481,"00:32:51,302","00:32:56,099","And this is an interesting piece for different reasons."

487,"00:33:12,657","00:33:13,991","No, I think that'll do it."
488,"00:33:13,991","00:33:14,992","Really appreciate your time."

490,"00:33:16,536","00:33:16,744","Absolutely."
491,"00:33:19,789","00:33:22,458","What Forrest created was something more than a treasure."
492,"00:33:24,711","00:33:26,087","It was something magical."
493,"00:33:26,587","00:33:28,881","It was something pure."
494,"00:33:29,257","00:33:36,681","It was something that captured your youth."
495,"00:33:37,014","00:33:37,432","All right."
496,"00:33:37,432","00:33:39,183","What the heck did you get there, son?"
497,"00:33:40,101","00:33:41,018","No, show me."
498,"00:33:42,061","00:33:46,315","And I wanted a way for others to experience the"
499,"00:33:46,315","00:33:49,193","highlights of what I experienced and to have that"
500,"00:33:49,777","00:33:50,820","classic adventure."
501,"00:33:50,903","00:33:56,492","I didn't want that to end."
502,"00:33:58,870","00:34:01,914","After I visited the treasure, a verbal"
503,"00:34:01,914","00:34:06,753","offer was made at that time and it was accepted."
504,"00:34:08,880","00:34:10,923","And then something changed."
505,"00:34:14,635","00:34:18,806","Forrest Fenn's treasure has sold for more than $1.3 million at auction."
506,"00:34:18,806","00:34:23,352","The treasure was auctioned off in 476 lots"
507,"00:34:23,352","00:34:26,647","with more than 1,500 people bidding on the items."
508,"00:34:27,148","00:34:30,151","It was really gutting when it didn't work out afterwards."
509,"00:34:30,651","00:34:36,199","Just this super excitement to just bummer."
510,"00:34:39,118","00:34:44,290","But I'm generally not deterred by those situations."
511,"00:34:44,665","00:34:46,626","There's always a more creative solution."
512,"00:34:47,710","00:34:48,252","What do you mean?"
513,"00:34:48,252","00:34:49,462","What do you get for a treasure? What do you have in mind?"
514,"00:34:51,839","00:34:53,674","Well, there's a new plan."
515,"00:35:02,892","00:35:04,560","Okay, my stick works."
516,"00:35:10,107","00:35:11,025","Okay, I think most..."
517,"00:35:12,360","00:35:13,027","We're gonna start that over."
518,"00:35:13,069","00:35:14,487","Nervous Mumbling]"
519,"00:35:16,656","00:35:21,452","I think most of us can agree Forrest Treasure Hunt didn't have the best ending,"
520,"00:35:21,786","00:35:23,120","but there's no denying it."
521,"00:35:23,120","00:35:25,498","The treasure hunt itself was a true adventure."
522,"00:35:26,249","00:35:30,253","So I've just returned from a different kind of adventure in the American West."
523,"00:35:30,753","00:35:33,297","This summer I orchestrated a daring plan."
524,"00:35:34,257","00:35:38,427","Not to discover a treasure, but to leave one hidden for someone else to find."
525,"00:35:39,220","00:35:40,847","This is not a parable or a metaphor."
526,"00:35:40,888","00:35:42,932","It's a real physical treasure."
527,"00:35:43,182","00:35:45,476","And that weighs about 60 pounds."
528,"00:35:46,143","00:35:50,731","It's filled with one kilogram gold bars, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, gold coins,"
529,"00:35:50,982","00:35:52,275","even a good size meteorite."
530,"00:35:52,984","00:35:56,070","Of course, it wouldn't be complete without a piece of forest."
531,"00:35:56,487","00:35:59,198","So I included some things from his treasure, like his dragon bracelet."
532,"00:35:59,574","00:36:01,868","And it's sitting out there somewhere right now,"
533,"00:36:02,285","00:36:04,036","just waiting for someone to discover it."
534,"00:36:04,453","00:36:06,080","So consider this the start of the race."
535,"00:36:06,747","00:36:07,373","The time's ticking."
536,"00:36:07,832","00:36:10,167","And we all know true adventure waits for no way."
537,"00:36:10,585","00:36:11,085","Good luck."
538,"00:36:15,131","00:36:17,174","There's one more thing you should know."
539,"00:36:18,092","00:36:21,512","I managed to sneak in some hints during the filming of this Netflix series."
540,"00:36:21,929","00:36:24,932","No one knows what the hints are besides me, not even the producers."
541,"00:36:26,017","00:36:28,561","So it's worth your time to watch and listen closely."
542,"00:36:29,520","00:36:31,230","I think Lewis Carroll said it best."
543,"00:36:31,981","00:36:35,484","In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take."
544,"00:36:36,319","00:36:36,694","Happy hunting."
